    <h3> Golden Butter Rice</h3>
        <p> This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice. 
        <p> It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it really is rice cooked in butter. </p>
        <p>This is my favorite version, with seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.</p></p>
