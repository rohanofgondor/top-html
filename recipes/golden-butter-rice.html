    <h3> Golden Butter Rice</h3>
        <p> This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice. 
        <p> It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it really is rice cooked in butter. </p>
        <p>This is my favorite version, with seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.</p></p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul> 
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Step to make t his trash </h4>
            <li> Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. As soon as butter starts to bubble, add in ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar, and salt. Cook, whisking, for 1 minute. </li>
            <li>Add rice, and stir until every grain is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake and swirl the pan to settle rice into an even layer, then reduce heat to medium-low.  </li>
